        <h2>About Outer Space</h2>
          <p>The barrier into outer space begins at about 60 miles above the Earth. This is where there are no longer enough oxygen molecules to breath (or to make the sky blue). Space is considered to be a vacuum because molecules are not close enough together to be able to transmit sound. Although there is no sound in space, it is not empty- there are other planets, stars and galaxies.</p>
